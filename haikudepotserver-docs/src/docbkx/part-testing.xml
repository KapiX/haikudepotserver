    <title>Testing</title>

    <para>
        This section covers how automated testing works in the project.
    </para>

    <para>
        The module &quot;haikudepotserver-core-test&quot; contains the automated integration tests for the
        &quot;haikudepotserver-core&quot; module.  It also provides (as a build artifact) a set of resources
        that can be used for testing other modules such as &quot;haikudepotserver-webapp&quot;.
    </para>

    <para>
        Most of the tests in the project so far are integration tests.  The reason behind this is because the
        ORM data objects are not POJOs and so they require a backing database of some description.  This is a
        facit of the ORM technology and makes it difficult to create very specific, contained tests.
