        <title>Unique Identifiers</title>
        <para>
            In general, an artifical identifier used to identify instances.  This artificial identifier has a name of
            &quot;code&quot;.  In some cases an existing natual key is already in place and so that attribute is used.  An
            example of this is the &quot;Pkg&quot; entity which is uniquely identified by its attribute &quot;name&quot;.  Note that the
            identifier is not the primary key.  In all cases, the database keys are artificial numerical
            identifiers.

        <title>Repositories</title>
        <para>
            A package is a cohesive piece of software or software sub-system for the Haiku operating system.
        </para>
        <para>
            Repositories are sources of packages.  A repository has a number of repository sources which are URLs
            that Haiku Depot Server can extract HPKR data from in order to get a catalog of what packages are
            available for that repository.  The URL is a base URL and resources are expected to be found at this
            base that provide information about the data in the repository.  You can find out more about the URLs and
            expected resources in the <link linkend="repositories">repository</link> section.
        </para>

        <para>
            Package versions' data is &quot;siloed&quot; between repositories, but some data such as localization, iconography and
            screenshots are shared.
