# the package.

# Configures a minimum version for the HaikiDepot desktop application.
# Versions of HD desktop application less than this minimum are

# When configured, this value will indicate the size of the cache dedicated to storing

# web infrastructure

# This value relates to the built-in JAWR web-resource compression and
# concatination system.  Review the JAWR documentation for details on
# the effects of configuring this value to true.

# This URL provides a base URL that the application can then add to when

# web security

# This is the number of seconds for which an authentication token is
# valid for.

#authentication.jws.expiryseconds=

# This secret is used to sign the tokens used to communicate between
# the client and the server.  This value should be very hard to guess.
# The output of the command "uuidgen" would be appropriate.  This
# value must be kept secret and not disclosed in public.
# commented out to force the value to be considered

#authentication.jws.sharedkey=

# This value is used in the production and consumption of the tokens
# between the client and the server.  It is intended that this is
# consistent for a given deployment.  Sample values that may be
# appropriate;
#
#   dev.hds
#   prod.hds
#   test.hds
